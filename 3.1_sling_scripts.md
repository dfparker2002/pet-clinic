## Sling scripts

Scripts, in Sling terminology, are view components or renderer, as they are sometimes referred to. Scripts are used to decouple content and its visual representation. Sling provides a very flexible way to render content, by using the concept of resource type. The resource type is specified by a property called ```sling:resourceType```. A resource type is the generally speaking the path of a folder.

### Resource types

Leaving the fact aside, that a resource type is basically only a path, a standard Sling distribution follows a simple pattern to determine the script to execute, when a resource is addressed. For example in the pet clinic, a page is a resource. In traditional content manangement systems, every page would be a resource.

    /content
    `-- petclinic
        `-- en
            `-- owners
                |-- add.html
                |-- detail.html
                |-- edit.html
                `-- list.html

In Sling on the contrary, pages for creating and manipulating owners can be different representations of the same resource.

    /
    +-- apps
    |   `-- petclinic
    |       `-- components
    |           `-- pages
    |               `-- owners
    |                   |-- add.groovy
    |                   |-- edit.groovy
    |                   |-- detail.groovy
    |                   `-- html.groovy
    `--content
        `-- petclinic
            `-- en
                `-- owners.xml
                    |-- jcr:primaryType: "nt:unstructured"
                    `-- sling:resourceType: "petclinic/components/pages/owners"

When comparing the two models, the obvious difference is that the Sling version is more complex, requiring more data. But that only half of the truth. In Sling, everything is a resource. Web pages can be treated as resources just as any other data in the repository. That being said, a resource being a page will most certainly be represented with a HTML page. But it could also be represented as JSON, XML or and other represenation one can think of.

### Selectors and extensions

The concept of a resource type and the decoupling of data and its representation comes with a even bigger benifit then just clean design. It allows for a more flexible usage of URLs. An URL points to something in the WWW. For example ```/content/petclinic/en/owners.html``` points to a web page called ```owners.html```. But that is not the resource. The resource being addressed is ```/content/petclinic/en/owners```. The ```.html``` extension indicates the resource should be rendered. In Sling, and other web frameworks as well, ```/content/petclinic/en/owners.json``` or ```/content/petclinic/en/owners.xml``` would not only be valid calls, but corresponding representions of the resource would be printed on the screen.

Detaching an URL from its extension adds another benefit - there is room in between which can be used. Anything between the resource and its extension is called a selector. If more then one selector has to be used, these are separated with a ```.```.

#### Build in selectors - the JsonRendererServlet

Sling comes with some build in selectors like ```infinity``` and ```tidy```. Those selectors are provided by the ```JsonRendererServlet``` and rendering JSON dumbs of an infinit depth and being pretty printed.

-  ```http://localhost:8080/sling/content/owners.tidy.infinity.json```
-  ```http://localhost:8080/sling/content/owners.infinity.tidy.json```

Are both valid calls but when testing them in the browser, they work differently. So the order of selectors being used matter.

#### The script resolution process

The tree of resources display used to illustrate a first difference between Sling and other web framework may have cause the question, how the various scripts are used. Selectors and extensions are the answer to this question. Scripts are usually written in JSPs, ESPs, Groovy scripts and so on, so the actual implementation language is of no relevance (as long a Sling can interpret or compile the files). The namming scheme though is of highest importance.

When a file is named after a HTTP method like GET or POST, then the script is invoked, if no other script is available. If a file name is ```html``` or the called similar to other extensions, and no selector is provided, then the file will be used for rendering (```groovy.html``` in our example). If a file is name differently, like ```add.jsp```, ```edit.groovy```, ```remove.esp``` ... Sling will handle the file names as registered selectors for that specific resource type.

In our example, four groovy scripts are provided for the resources of resource type ```petclinic/components/pages/owners``` - ```add.groovy```, ```details.groovy```, ```edit.groovy``` and ```html.groovy```. The files determine a set of for three possible selectors and one standard html renderer.

The resulting URLs are

-  ```http://localhost:8080/content/petclinic/en/owners.add.html```
-  ```http://localhost:8080/content/petclinic/en/owners.details.html```
-  ```http://localhost:8080/content/petclinic/en/owners.edit.html```
-  ```http://localhost:8080/content/petclinic/en/owners.html```

```http://localhost:8080/content/petclinic/en/owners.add.edit.details.html``` would be valid as well, but only the first selector is used to invoke a script. The other could be examined and used in Services or beans though.
